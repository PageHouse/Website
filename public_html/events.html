        <h2>Rotation</h2>
        <p>Rotation is a 2-week period during the beginning of freshman year where freshman go around to each house, eat dinner, and participate in events to figure out where they fit best. Page House has a "Chill at Page" event, where students get together to enjoy grilled food from our Grill Team, soak upperclassmen in dunk tanks, and get to know the Pageboys.</p>

        <h2>Beach Day</h2>
        <p>If you're going to come to Southern California, a day on the beach is a must. Pageboys come together to spend some quality time on the beach, whether it be tossing a frisbee, playing volleyball, soaking in the sun, or getting in the water (remember to shuffle your feet fellas!). At the end of the day, Page House gathers to enjoy some s'mores and wieners around a fire.</p>

        <h2>Page Interhouse</h2>
        <p>Page throws the first interhouse of the year! Pageboys put their heads together and throw a fantastic party for all of Caltech to enjoy. Every year, Page Interhouse has an exciting theme. Previous themes have included Club Penguin, Flat Earth Society, Spongebob, and Speakeasy: Yeezy for Preezy the Interheezy and more! Pageboys build and paint the dance floor from scratch and give Techers the time of their lives with tons of food, music, and good times.</p>

        <h2>Happy Hour</h2>
        <p>Pageboys like to wind down at the end of the week with Friday night happy hours. With a bartender and many drinks for people to enjoy, students come hang out in the lounge and have a good time.</p>

        <h2>Bubbly</h2>
        <p>On the last day of classes for the term, Page House sets up a champagne & grill event called Bubbly. During Bubbly, Pageboys dress up and mingle in the Courtyard or Millikan pond, and Grill Team cooks a fantastic meal for everyone. It’s a great break before finals! On the final Bubbly of the year, we take pictures as a house in front of Millikan.</p>

        <h2>Ski Trip</h2>
        <p>At the start of Winter Term, Page House heads up to Mammoth Mountain to hit the slopes and escape Southern California for a weekend. Pageboys can spend all day skiing or snowboarding down Mammoth, ice-skating in the crisp and wintry air, exploring the frosty nature trails, or relaxing comfortably back at the lodges.</p>

        <h2>PF Party</h2>

        <h2>Beach Trip</h2>

        <h2>Cocktail Party</h2>
        <p>Page House throws Cocktail Party, where people dress up nicely, enjoy each other’s company, and savor some fancy drinks and snacks. Yeah, we like to splurge a little (just a teensy bit).</p>
